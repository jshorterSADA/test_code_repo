# addNums.py: Simple Number Addition Utility

## Overview

This repository contains a single Python script, `addNums.py`, which provides a utility function to add two numbers. The script focuses on demonstrating basic function definition, input type conversion, and structured logging, including the use of correlation IDs for tracing operations.

## Features

*   **Number Addition**: A function to sum two numerical inputs.
*   **Type Coercion**: Attempts to convert string inputs to integers before addition.
*   **Structured Logging**: Utilizes Python's `logging` module to output informational messages about function execution.
*   **Correlation ID Integration**: Supports passing and utilizing a correlation ID to link related log messages across different operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x

### Installation

No specific installation steps are required beyond downloading the `addNums.py` file.

## Usage

To use the `add_two_numbers` function, simply import it into your Python script and call it with two arguments. An optional `corrID` can be provided for logging purposes.

```python
from addNums import add_two_numbers

# Example 1: Adding two integers
result1 = add_two_numbers(5, 3)
print(f"Result 1: {result1}")
# Expected output (logs will also be printed):
# <current_correlation_ID> - Function `add_two_numbers` called with num1=5, num2=3.
# <current_correlation_ID> - Attempting to convert inputs to integers.
# <current_correlation_ID> - Successfully added 5 and 3. Result: 8
# Result 1: 8

# Example 2: Adding two numbers provided as strings
result2 = add_two_numbers("10", "20", corrID="my-specific-id-123")
print(f"Result 2: {result2}")
# Expected output (logs will also be printed):
# my-specific-id-123 - Function `add_two_numbers` called with num1=10, num2=20.
# my-specific-id-123 - Attempting to convert inputs to integers.
# my-specific-id-123 - Successfully added 10 and 20. Result: 30
# Result 2: 30

# Example 3: Invalid input (will raise ValueError)
try:
    add_two_numbers("five", 3)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error caught: {e}")
# Expected output (logs will also be printed for the function call):
# <current_correlation_ID> - Function `add_two_numbers` called with num1=five, num2=3.
# <current_correlation_ID> - Attempting to convert inputs to integers.
# Error caught: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'five'
```

## Code Details

### `add_two_numbers(num1, num2, corrID=None)` Function

This function is designed to sum two numbers.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `num1`: The first number. Can be an integer or a string representation of an integer.
    *   `num2`: The second number. Can be an integer or a string representation of an integer.
    *   `corrID`: (Optional) A string representing a correlation ID to be used for logging messages generated by this specific function call. If not provided, a globally defined `correlation_ID` is used.
*   **Returns**:
    *   `int`: The sum of `num1` and `num2` after conversion to integers.
*   **Behavior**:
    *   Attempts to convert both `num1` and `num2` to integers using `int()`.
    *   Logs informational messages at various stages of execution, including function call, input conversion attempt, and successful addition. Log messages are prefixed with the determined correlation ID.

### Logging

The script configures Python's `logging` module to output messages at the `INFO` level. The log format is set to `%(message)s`, which means only the log message content (including the pre-formatted correlation ID) will be printed to standard output.

*   **Configuration**:
    ```python
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(message)s')
    ```
*   **Correlation ID in Logs**:
    Each log message is prefixed with a correlation ID. For informational messages, the format is `ID - Message`. For error messages (though not present in this function's current error handling), the intended format for the prefix is `correlation_ID:ID Message`.

### Error Handling

**Important Note**: In the current implementation, the `add_two_numbers` function attempts to convert `num1` and `num2` to integers directly using `int()`. If either input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if it's a non-numeric string or `None`), a `ValueError` will be raised and the program will terminate if not caught by the caller. There is no internal `try-except` block within the `add_two_numbers` function to gracefully handle these conversion errors.

## Configuration

### Global Correlation ID

A global `correlation_ID` variable is defined within `addNums.py`.
```python
correlation_ID ="41131d34-334c-488a-bce2-a7642b27cf35"
```
This ID is used by `add_two_numbers` if no specific `corrID` is passed to the function. You can modify this value directly in the script if a different default correlation ID is desired.

### Logging Level

The default logging level is `INFO`. This can be adjusted by changing the `level` parameter in `logging.basicConfig()` at the beginning of the script (e.g., to `logging.DEBUG` for more verbose output, or `logging.WARNING` for less).
