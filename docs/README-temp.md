# Number Addition Utility

## Introduction
This repository contains a simple Python script, `addNums.py`, which provides a core function to add two numbers. The primary focus of this utility is to demonstrate clear logging practices, especially incorporating correlation IDs for enhanced traceability and debugging.

## Features
*   **Flexible Input**: The `add_two_numbers` function can accept both integer and string representations of numbers, attempting to convert strings to integers for calculation.
*   **Comprehensive Logging**: Integrates detailed logging for every step of the function's execution, including input reception, type conversion attempts, and successful operations.
*   **Correlation ID Support**: Utilizes correlation IDs to link related log messages across different operations, significantly aiding in debugging and monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this script, you will need:
*   Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation
This project consists of a single Python script. No specific installation steps are required beyond ensuring you have the `addNums.py` file in your desired working directory.

```bash
# Simply place the addNums.py file in your project.
# Example:
# cp path/to/addNums.py .
```

### Usage
To use the `add_two_numbers` function, import `addNums` into your Python script and call the function with your desired numerical inputs.

```python
import addNums

# Example 1: Adding two integers
print("--- Example 1 ---")
result1 = addNums.add_two_numbers(10, 20)
print(f"Calculated Result: {result1}\n") # Expected: Logs for 10 and 20, then Result: 30

# Example 2: Adding two numbers provided as strings
print("--- Example 2 ---")
result2 = addNums.add_two_numbers("50", "75")
print(f"Calculated Result: {result2}\n") # Expected: Logs for "50" and "75", then Result: 125

# Example 3: Adding numbers with a custom correlation ID
print("--- Example 3 ---")
result3 = addNums.add_two_numbers(100, 200, corrID="operation-X-456")
print(f"Calculated Result: {result3}\n") # Expected: Logs using "operation-X-456", then Result: 300

# Example 4: Attempting to add non-numeric inputs (will raise an error)
print("--- Example 4 (Error Case) ---")
# Uncommenting the line below will cause a ValueError and terminate the script
# result4 = addNums.add_two_numbers("apple", 5)
# print(f"Calculated Result: {result4}\n")
```

## Code Structure

### `addNums.py`
This is the main script that encapsulates the number addition logic and logging configuration. It sets up basic logging for the module and defines the `add_two_numbers` function.

#### `add_two_numbers(num1, num2, corrID=None)`
*   **Purpose**: To compute the sum of two numerical inputs. The function is designed to be robust by attempting to convert string inputs to integers before performing the addition.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `num1`: The first operand for the addition. It can be an `int` or a `str` that can be successfully converted to an `int`.
    *   `num2`: The second operand for the addition. Similar to `num1`, it can be an `int` or a `str` convertible to an `int`.
    *   `corrID` (optional): An identifier string used to correlate log messages related to this specific function call. If provided, it overrides the global `correlation_ID`. If `None`, the global default is used.
*   **Return Value**: Returns an `int` representing the sum of `num1` and `num2` after both have been successfully converted to integers.
*   **Details**: The function initiates by determining the correlation ID for the current execution. It then logs the function call with its parameters. It attempts to convert `num1` and `num2` to integers. Upon successful conversion and addition, the result is logged, and the sum is returned.

## Error Handling
The `add_two_numbers` function explicitly attempts to convert both `num1` and `num2` to integers using `int()`. If either input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if a non-numeric string like `"hello"` is provided), a `ValueError` will be raised, leading to the termination of the script. The logging system ensures that all operations, including the initial function call and the attempt to convert inputs, are recorded before such an error occurs.

## Logging
The script leverages Python's standard `logging` module for all operational messages.
*   **Configuration**: Logging is configured at the `INFO` level. The log format is set to `%(message)s`, ensuring that only the custom-formatted message (which includes the correlation ID) is printed, without additional default prefixes (like timestamps or log levels).
*   **Correlation IDs**: Every log message generated by the `add_two_numbers` function includes a correlation ID. This ID is either supplied directly via the `corrID` parameter or defaults to a globally defined `correlation_ID`. Informational messages are prefixed with `[correlation_ID] - `, while a different format (`correlation_ID:[ID] `) is specified for error messages (though no explicit error messages are generated in the current snippet due to `ValueError` causing termination).

## Configuration
The `addNums.py` script allows for the configuration of a default correlation ID:
*   `correlation_ID`: A global string variable that holds the default correlation identifier. This ID is used in log messages when no specific `corrID` is passed to the `add_two_numbers` function.
    *   **Default Value**: `"41131d34-334c-488a-bce2-a7642b27cf35"`
