# `addNums.py` Documentation

## Overview

The `addNums.py` script provides a core utility function, `add_two_numbers`, designed for robustly adding two numerical inputs. It prioritizes operational traceability by integrating correlation IDs into its logging mechanism, ensuring that all system activities and potential issues are clearly trackable. This script is ideal for environments requiring detailed insight into function execution and consistent log formatting.

## Features

*   **Flexible Input Handling**: The `add_two_numbers` function attempts to process inputs provided as either integers or their string representations.
*   **Correlation ID Integration**: All log messages generated by the `add_two_numbers` function are prefixed with a correlation ID, enabling easy tracing of specific operations within log aggregators.
*   **Standardized Logging**: Utilizes Python's standard `logging` module, configured to output messages in a specific format to accommodate correlation IDs.

## Getting Started

To integrate and use the `add_two_numbers` function within your Python application, simply import it from the `addNums` module.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x

### Usage Example

```python
from addNums import add_two_numbers

# Example 1: Adding numbers using the globally defined correlation ID
print("--- Example 1: Using global correlation ID ---")
sum_result_1 = add_two_numbers("10", 25)
print(f"Function call result: {sum_result_1}\n")

# Example 2: Adding numbers with a custom correlation ID
print("--- Example 2: Providing a custom correlation ID ---")
custom_corr_id = "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef"
sum_result_2 = add_two_numbers(5, "7", corrID=custom_corr_id)
print(f"Function call result: {sum_result_2}\n")

# Example 3: Demonstrating behavior with non-convertible input
# (Note: As per current implementation, this will raise a ValueError)
print("--- Example 3: Non-convertible input (will raise ValueError) ---")
try:
    sum_result_3 = add_two_numbers("hello", 5)
    print(f"Function call result: {sum_result_3}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught an expected error: {e}")
# Expected log output from the function itself will precede this print.
```

## API Reference

### `add_two_numbers(num1, num2, corrID=None)`

Calculates the sum of two numbers, attempting to convert string inputs to integers. All steps and results are logged with an associated correlation ID.

#### Parameters

*   `num1` (int or str): The first operand for the addition. If a string, the function attempts to convert it to an integer.
*   `num2` (int or str): The second operand for the addition. If a string, the function attempts to convert it to an integer.
*   `corrID` (str, optional): An explicit correlation ID for the current function call. If provided, it overrides the global `correlation_ID`. Defaults to `None`.

#### Returns

*   `int`: The sum of `num1` and `num2` after they have been successfully converted to integers.

#### Behavior

1.  **Correlation ID Resolution**: Determines the `current_corr_id` to be used for all log messages within the function's execution. It prioritizes the `corrID` parameter if provided; otherwise, it falls back to the global `correlation_ID` defined in `addNums.py`.
2.  **Input Conversion Attempt**: Both `num1` and `num2` are passed to `int()` for conversion.
3.  **Logging**: Informational messages are logged at key stages, including function entry, attempt to convert inputs, and successful sum calculation. These messages are prefixed with `[correlation_ID] - ` (e.g., `41131d34-334c-488a-bce2-a7642b27cf35 - Function add_two_numbers called...`).
4.  **Sum Calculation**: Upon successful conversion of both inputs to integers, their sum is computed.

#### Error Handling

The function's docstring states an intention to "gracefully handle cases where inputs cannot be converted to numbers," and internal comments suggest the conversion logic is "now correctly indented within a try block to catch conversion errors." However, based on the provided code implementation, the explicit `try-except` block around the `int()` conversions is not present. As a result, if `num1` or `num2` cannot be converted into an integer (e.g., if they are non-numeric strings), a `ValueError` will be raised directly, halting the execution of the function. Consumers of `add_two_numbers` should implement their own error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) to manage `ValueError` if non-convertible inputs are anticipated.

## Configuration

### Logging Configuration

The script configures the Python `logging` module at the global level upon import. This ensures that all messages generated within the script conform to a consistent format.

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(message)s')
```
*   `level=logging.INFO`: Sets the minimum logging level to `INFO`. This means messages of `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` severity will be processed.
*   `format='%(message)s'`: This format string is deliberately concise. It allows the `add_two_numbers` function to programmatically construct the entire log message, including custom correlation ID prefixes, ensuring flexibility and adherence to the desired output structure.

### Global Correlation ID

A default correlation ID is defined within the `addNums.py` module. This ID serves as a fallback identifier for operations when a specific `corrID` is not explicitly passed to the `add_two_numbers` function.

```python
correlation_ID = "41131d34-334c-488a-bce2-a7642b27cf35"
```
This module-level variable can be inspected or potentially modified (though not recommended for runtime changes) to adjust the default correlation context.

## Logging Details

The `add_two_numbers` function meticulously logs its operational flow to provide detailed insights and enhance traceability within a system.

*   **Informational Messages**: These messages provide updates on the function's progress, such as when it's called, its attempt to convert inputs, and the final result of the addition. Each informational message is formatted with a dynamic prefix determined by the current correlation ID:
    *   `[correlation_ID] - [actual log message content]`
    *   Example: `41131d34-334c-488a-bce2-a7642b27cf35 - Successfully added 10 and 25. Result: 35`
*   **Error Message Formatting (Planned)**: The code defines an `error_prefix` variable (`correlation_ID:{current_corr_id} `), indicating an intention to use a distinct format for error messages. However, in the current implementation of `add_two_numbers`, direct error logging (e.g., via `logging.error()`) for input conversion failures is not present, as `ValueError`s are raised unhandled.
