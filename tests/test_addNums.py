To create a self-contained unit test that validates the fix for the `add_two_numbers` function, we'll embed the corrected function directly within the test file. This ensures the test always runs against the intended version of the code.

The original error occurred because `num2` (the original input) was used in the addition instead of `num2_int` (the converted integer value), leading to a `TypeError` when `num2` was a string. The fix replaces `num2` with `num2_int` in the addition.

The unit test will include several test cases, with a strong focus on the scenarios that caused the original error, i.e., mixing string and integer inputs or having both inputs as strings.
