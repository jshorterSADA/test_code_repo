# Documentation Templates

This directory contains generic documentation templates designed to standardize project documentation across the organization.

## How to Use

1.  **Copy** the desired template file into your project's `docs/` directory (or root if appropriate).
2.  **Rename** the file if necessary (e.g., remove "Template" from the name).
3.  **Search and Replace** the placeholders with your project's specific details. Common placeholders include:
    *   `[Project Name]`
    *   `[Company Name]`
    *   `[Cloud Provider]`
    *   `[IaC Tool]`
    *   `[CI/CD Tool]`
    *   `[Repository URL]`
4.  **Commit** the customized documentation to your repository.
